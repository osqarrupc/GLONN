abstract: The optimal power flow problem is fundamental in electrical networks for determining optimal power generation setpoints. However, near real-time solutions are required with the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and power electronic devices. This paper introduces GLONN, a novel neural network architecture that integrates graph neural networks with Lagrangian principles to solve the DC optimal power flow problem. GLONN leverages the grid's structural information via graph convolutions and enforces physical feasibility through a Lagrangian-based loss formulation, enabling both fast inference and constraint satisfaction. We evaluate GLONN on benchmark electrical networks, comparing its performance against traditional solvers and baseline graph neural network models. Results show that GLONN achieves deviations of less than 10% from the global minimum of the objective function under normal conditions while reducing computation time by up to a factor of 40. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid physics-informed and topology-aware neural networks for real-time power system optimization.

<p class="Section">1 &ensp; What are we proposing? GLONN</p>
    <p class="BodyText Justified">In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture called <b>GLONN</b>, which combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Lagrangian Neural Network (LNN) to solve the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problem. GLONN leverages the structural information of the electrical grid and incorporates physical constraints directly into the learning process.
