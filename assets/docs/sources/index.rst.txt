GLONN Documentation
==========================

This documentation website details GLONN, a novel hybrid neural architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Lagrangian Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem efficiently and robustly. The proposed approach combines the structural learning power of GNNs with the interpretability and constraint-handling capabilities of Lagrangian methods.
